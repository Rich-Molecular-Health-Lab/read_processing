# Before you begin

>You should use this script if you are processing raw sequencing files on our lab's sequencing computer (the System76 laptop). If you plan to run these scripts from a different computer, you should either **1. switch to the original read processing script and remotely access the HCC** or **2. verify that your computer has the  minimum computing requirements needed (only high performance PCs with NVIDA will work) and mirror my dorado directory structure.**

## What is different about this script?

Now that we are working locally, the chunks below that are written to the `bash` engine instead of the default `r` engine will automatically get sent to your terminal as a bash script. You will see this at work in the chunk below.

## Pull all updates from the github repository

We want to make sure we have sent all our updates to the github repository and then pull anything new as well. This avoids the tedious process of cross-checking and merging any edits not matching between the two locations.

```{bash}
git add .
git commit -m "checking updates before new basecalling run"
git push origin main
```

```{bash}
git pull origin main
```

## Transfer sequencing data

You could do this direct from the command line, but sometimes I just prefer doing things by icons. Go to the directory icon and enter the following path in the box:
```
/var/lib/minknow/data
```
From there, find the parent directory specific to your most recent sequencing run. Right click the directory icon, and then select `Copy_to` to copy the entire directory to the following path:
```
/Home/GitRepos/read_processing/seqRuns
```
Now you should rename that directory with the less cumbersome `seqrun` name that matches the syntax you used in the params of this document.

# Read Processing

## Basecalling

Now open the shell script at the following path:
```
read_processing/batch_scripts/basecall_local.sh
```
Update the seqrun and sampleset variables in the first line to match your current sequencing run. Save the file again, close it, and run the chunk below.


```{r}
system2("bash", args = scripts$local$basecall, wait = FALSE)
```

## Trimming and Filtering

Now open the shell script at the following path:
```
read_processing/batch_scripts/trimWG_local.sh
```
Update the seqrun and kit variables in the first line to match your current sequencing run. Save the file again, close it, and run the chunk below.

```{r}
system2("bash", args = scripts$local$trimWG, wait = FALSE)
```
